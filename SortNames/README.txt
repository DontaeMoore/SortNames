Q1 Assignment 

Instructions:
Included in my submission is a java file, the names file, and this README


All we have to do is compile it and run it. Open the command prompt, and navigate to this folder. Ensure the jdk is installed in your windows.
Run javac NameReader.java to compile, once done the .class file should be created inside the SortNames folder
Run java NameReader to run the program. Outputed should be the names sorted correctly in the stout. My program also creates a file and outputs the names
in the same folder.

Now if you add the argument "Reverse" case sensitive, to your run command, resulting in the new command "java NameReader Reverse" 
The sort will be reversed.

Program also runs in Ubuntu.
